				When a service does work it could make changes into two or more systems, and many things can go wrong
				before the second or subsequent changes causing them to fail or never happen.
			</p>
			<p>
				This is called "Dual Writes" and it can be the source of hidden errors in a distributed system.
			</p>

				<h3>Dual Writes: When Everything Is Working</h3>
				<ol>
					<li class="fragment">Your service writes the big order update to the database</li>
					<li class="fragment">You send on an event about the order to notify anyone that's listening</li>
					<li class="fragment">Anyone that is listening gets the update and takes action</li>
				</ol>

			<h3>Broken Solutions</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Publish the message <strong>BEFORE</strong> writing changes into the database.
					<small class="fragment">Now remote systems have record of things that never "happened".</small>
				</li>
				<li>
					The missing data is small or happens infrequently and we've got logs.
					<small class="fragment">Little errors over time compound and snowball into bigger errors.</small>
				</li>
			</ul>

				<h3>How The Outbox Works</h3>
			</section>
			<section>
				<p>
					The publishing of messages gets broken up into two separate events.
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>The messages are written into the database along with the other changes.</li>
					<li>They are then read by a second process to be published to the message broker.</li>
				</ol>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Writing the Messages</h3>
				<p>
					During the first action a transaction or atomic write is used to ensure that all of the changes make it into
					the system.
				</p>
				<p>
					<small>
						Most databases whether they are SQL or NoSQL offer some way to perform an atomic write.
					</small>
				</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Publishing the messages</h3>
				<p>
					During the second action a message is pushed or polled into the Message Relay and published into the message
					broker if it is available.
				</p>
				<p>
					<small>Relational databases may offer a write ahead log that can be followed</small>
					<small>Some databases such as AWS DynamoDB offer streams that can be processed using serverless
					       functions</small>
				</p>
			</section>
		</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Outbox Message Publication</h3>
				<ol>
					<li class="fragment">The service writes both the data and messages within a single transaction to the
					                     database
					</li>
					<li class="fragment">The Message Relay will receive or poll the database for new unpublished messages</li>
					<li class="fragment">The Message Relay will publish messages into the message broker</li>
					<li class="fragment">(Optional) The Message Relay will update the database marking messages as
					                     published
					</li>
					<li class="fragment">The other services will receive the messages at-least-once</li>
				</ol>
			</section>

			<h3>At-Least-Once Guarantee</h3>
			<p>
				The consumers of the message will now be guaranteed to receive the message at-least-once.
			</p>
			<p>
				There are situations where the Message Relay may fail after publishing but before marking messages as published
				and that would result in sending the message again. It is for this reason that it is important for the message
				consumers to be idempotent.
			</p>
			<p>
				If the Message Relay is down then publishing has stopped but no messages are lost.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h3>Re-Playability</h3>
			<p>
				The messages may now reside forever or for a duration of your choosing in the publishing systems database.
				Should a need to replay the message come up then it'll be a simple matter of running a special process to
				re-publish the messages from the desired timeframe. Functionally this isn't much different than how the
				Message Relay functions, just on a ad-hoc basis.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h3>Asynchronous Only</h3>
			<p>
				This Outbox Pattern can only be applied to improve asynchronous actions. Synchronous calls in your system will
				require different methods to ensure reliability, or should be refactored to be asynchronous.
